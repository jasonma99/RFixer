I'm getting a @@pretty clear sense that this project isn't going anywhere as it is currently @@configured.  Just to satisfy myself, though, let me throw out a couple of @@observations for the group to react to, along the lines of Steve 's "However" @@section of his memo:@@@@1.  Running this thing as a baseload unit won't work.  The fuel cost is a @@killer.  However, I keep thinking about the $200/mwh 4 Corners spot price @@someone mentioned on the phone.   Is there enough volatility at 4 Corners to @@support a peaking merchant plant?  How often are those types of opportunities @@available, and could a power plant in Alb. capture that upside by @@transporting power to 4 Corners over PNMs system?  @@  @@2.  We have been assuming that the power plant should be a baseload plant.  @@Someone on the phone last week had some numbers indicating that the DOE/DOD @@electric load at Kirtland had a fairly high load factor.  I think we have all @@assumed further that the plant should run at a high load factor to sell @@surplus power into the grid (either at 4 Corners or, after N.M. elec. @@restructuring, into the Alb. area).   I just found the numbers I was @@remembering on the conf. call--1998 peak load was 63.6 mw, and total annual @@1998 consumption was 334.5 million Kwh.  By my lawyer-math, that is about a @@60% load factor for DOE.  If the DOE load is only 60% L.F., and the plant @@only generates surplus power when it can capture profit opportunities that @@arise when the market clearing price at 4 Corners or in Albuquerque exceeds @@some benchmark rate ($.05/Kwh?  $.10/Kwh?  higher?)  the plant might run at a @@30-40% load factor on an annual basis.  The question is can we reduce the @@capital cost significantly by building a peaker instead of a baseload unit?@@@@3.  Could we get debt financing for a 140 mw plant that had a baseload demand @@charge contract for only 65 mw (i.e., DOE) but sold the rest of its output @@into the grid only when profit opportunities arose?      @@@@4.  If the answer to 3. is no, would ENA backstop the debt financing by @@signing a demand charge contract for all surplus power over and above what @@the government needs?   At what price?  Based on its knowledge of volatility @@and profit opportunities currently available at 4 Corners, and future profit @@opportunities that will be available in Albuq. is that just a dumb bet, or @@would ENA get interested if someone else (i.e., DOE) split the risk and @@reward?  @@@@John , how much of the information in your analysis could be sanitized in a @@way that we could provide it to Dennis Langley ?  If we pull the plug on the @@project, I'd like to be in a position that we could let him in on some of our @@information on why the turbines we would use can't provide acceptable @@economics.
