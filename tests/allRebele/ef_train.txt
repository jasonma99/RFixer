I'm getting a @@pretty clear sense that this project isn't going anywhere as it is currently @@configured.  Just to satisfy myself, though, let me throw out a couple of @@observations for the group to react to, along the lines of Steve 's "However" @@section of his memo:@@@@1.  Running this thing as a baseload unit won't work.  The fuel cost is a @@killer.  However, I keep thinking about the $200/mwh 4 Corners spot price @@someone mentioned on the phone.   Is there enough volatility at 4 Corners to @@support a peaking merchant plant?  How often are those types of opportunities @@available, and could a power plant in Alb. capture that upside by @@transporting power to 4 Corners over PNMs system?  @@  @@2.  We have been assuming that the power plant should be a baseload plant.  @@Someone on the phone last week had some numbers indicating that the DOE/DOD @@electric load at Kirtland had a fairly high load factor.  I think we have all @@assumed further that the plant should run at a high load factor to sell @@surplus power into the grid (either at 4 Corners or, after N.M. elec. @@restructuring, into the Alb. area).   I just found the numbers I was @@remembering on the conf. call--1998 peak load was 63.6 mw, and total annual @@1998 consumption was 334.5 million Kwh.  By my lawyer-math, that is about a @@60% load factor for DOE.  If the DOE load is only 60% L.F., and the plant @@only generates surplus power when it can capture profit opportunities that @@arise when the market clearing price at 4 Corners or in Albuquerque exceeds @@some benchmark rate ($.05/Kwh?  $.10/Kwh?  higher?)  the plant might run at a @@30-40% load factor on an annual basis.  The question is can we reduce the @@capital cost significantly by building a peaker instead of a baseload unit?@@@@3.  Could we get debt financing for a 140 mw plant that had a baseload demand @@charge contract for only 65 mw (i.e., DOE) but sold the rest of its output @@into the grid only when profit opportunities arose?      @@@@4.  If the answer to 3. is no, would ENA backstop the debt financing by @@signing a demand charge contract for all surplus power over and above what @@the government needs?   At what price?  Based on its knowledge of volatility @@and profit opportunities currently available at 4 Corners, and future profit @@opportunities that will be available in Albuq. is that just a dumb bet, or @@would ENA get interested if someone else (i.e., DOE) split the risk and @@reward?  @@@@John , how much of the information in your analysis could be sanitized in a @@way that we could provide it to Dennis Langley ?  If we pull the plug on the @@project, I'd like to be in a position that we could let him in on some of our @@information on why the turbines we would use can't provide acceptable @@economics.

(TEP) has signed a five-year wholesale contract to supply 60@@megawatts of electricity to Phelps Dodge Energy Services.@@   The contract calls for TEP, beginning in March of 2001, to supply@@the power at all times except during the company's peak customer@@energy demand periods from July through September of each year.@@   TEP Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer James S.@@Pignatelli said the contract is an important one for both companies.@@"This agreement provides a comfort factor for Phelps Dodge as it plans@@ahead for its energy needs," Pignatelli said. "And for TEP, the@@contract provides a stable, profitable margin for five years and a@@solid boost to our financial outlook in a volatile energy market."@@   Pignatelli said the company expects the agreement to generate@@revenues of about $30 million annually.@@   The contract gives Phelps Dodge the option of receiving the power@@at several of its operations outside TEP's service territory. Under@@the contract, TEP also can interrupt delivery of power to Phelps Dodge@@if the utility experiences significant loss of any electric generating@@resources.@@   Separate from this agreement, the Phelps Dodge Sierrita copper and@@molybdenum mine south of Tucson is a TEP retail customer.@@   TEP is the primary subsidiary of UniSource Energy Corp.@@(NYSE: UNS), and Arizona's second-largest investor-owned electric@@utility.@@   TEP Public Affairs@@   P.O.

Since I did not get a chance to meet with you yesterday, I would like to lay @@out a few thoughts in this email:@@@@1. Additional areas that might require immediate attention:@@@@? Consider existing "Bets" and large positions already in the books and ways @@of adjusting these bets, if necessary (excluding CA):@@  - NY: large short positions behind Central Hudson and ConEd (IBM deal and @@others)@@  - Carolinas: Standard Offer timing (Springs, Eli Lily , others)@@  - Illinois: concentration of short regulated positions@@@@? Quick handle on option positions: do we need to switch customers in some @@areas? what options we ought to exercise tomorrow? next week? etc.@@  - options embedded in the deals@@  - regulatory switch options@@  - retail index options@@  - EAM options@@@@? Managing value from restructuring legacy deals: in the process of reviewing @@the 13 deals, we discovered some provisions in the contracts that were not @@captured and managed properly - they might require immediate attention to @@minimize losses in these deals.@@@@2. Managing Regulatory Exposure@@@@? Approximately 80% of EES regulatory exposure is behind 40 utilities@@? In the process of rate case decomposition, we need to identify the main @@components of each rate structure - create a rate case formula@@? These components will fall into two categories: hedgeable (gas, coal, @@heating oil fuel costs, inflation, etc.) and "unhedgeable" (CTC timing, @@standard offer, etc.)@@@@  Hedgeable Component      Unhedgeable Component@@Strategy: Manage within the respective commodity books   Capitalize on @@portfolio diversification across the country@@          Look for "macro" hedges and focus activities of EGA@@@@Pricing:  You know best       Risk-based: higher premiums for greater @@uncertainty@@@@Policy:  Internal authorizations only on who, how and when to hedge Develop a @@limit framework and propose a limit to the BOD@@@@Exposure: Existing VaR model will suffice     Develop and implement stress @@scenarios to quantify exposure@@@@3. Other Considerations@@@@? Curve management: clear responsibilities, periodic review and validation@@? Interaction with the EAM world: EAM projects create long positions, pricing @@bundled deals with an EAM component@@? Flash-to-actual catch up: liquidations validate curve assumptions@@? Attention to EES-Canada: currently executed a power deal and a few gas deals@@? Process for pricing smaller mid-market deals: sacrificing quantity for @@quality - force originators to develop standard deal structures@@@@I could elaborate further on these points. Vlady .
